Given the following Set ADT:

Set:  A collection of unique objects.

	Definitions (provided by user):
		maxObjects:  An integer specifying the maximum number of objects in the set

	void Set(int maxObjects)
		Effect:  Instantiates this set with a capacity of maxObjects and initializes the
				set to the empty set
		Precondition:  maxObjects > 0
		Postcondition:  This set is empty.

void Set()
		Effect:  Instantiates this set with a capacity of 100 and initialize this set to an 
empty state
		Postcondition:  This set is empty

void add(Object object)
Effect:  Adds an item to the set.
Postcondition:  The given object is in this set.

boolean contains(Object object)
	Effect:  Determines whether the object is in the set
	Postcondition:  This set is unchanged.
			  Return value = (object is in the set)

Object getFirst()
	Effect:  Returns a copy of the first element in the set

			  Return value = (the first element of the set)

Object getNext()
	Effect:  Returns a copy of the next element in the set
	Postcondition:  This bag is unchanged
		              Return value = (some element of this set other than those already
				returned by the last call to getFirst() and subsequent
				calls to getNext(); if all elements have been accessed by
				that previous sequence of calls, then null is returned.

boolean remove(Object object)
	Effect:  Deletes the object from the set.
	Postcondition:  The given object is not in this set.
		 	  Returns value = (object was deleted from set)

integer size()
	Effect:  Determines the number of objects in the set
	Postcondition:  This set is unchanged
			  Return value = (the number of elements in the set)

ADT Specification
Point: A location on a 2D plane.
	Definitions (provided by user):
		x: A double coordinate specifying the alignment of the point with the horizontal grid
		y: A double coordinate specifying the alignment of the point with the vertical grid
	double getX()
Effect: Returns the x coordinate of the point
Postcondition: The point is unchanged
	Return value = (the x coordinate of the point)
	double getY()
		Effect: Returns the y coordinate of the point
		Postcondition: The point is unchanged
			Return value = (the y coordinate of the point)
	Void setX(double x)
		Effect: Instantiates the point’s x coordinate
		Postcondition: The x coordinate of selected point becomes the entered value
	Void setY(double y)
		Effect: Instantiates the point’s y coordinate
		Postcondition: The y coordinate of selected point becomes the entered value
	Void moveTo(double x, double y)
		Effect: Instantiates both x and y coordinates / moves the point
		Postcondition: The point is moved to a new location / the x and y coordinates of the point becomes the entered values.
